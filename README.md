# Simple-Ipod
Created a simple ipod on a De1-Soc using verilog,  assembly and picoblaze. This ipod was able to read flash memory to play a .jic song file. It was also configured to take input from an attached keyboard to play, pause and change forwards and backwards direction. Switches from the De1 were able to speed up, slow down and reset the speed of the song being played.
